/**
 * Instructions are organized under `data/instructions` by folders named after
 *   the first letter in the instruction.
 * The files are named what the instruction is called, but in lowercase.
 * For example, `AAA` is located at `data/instructions/a/aaa.yaml`.
 *
 * For conditional instructions (eg. `CMOVcc`), the data file is simply
 *   `data/instructions/c/cmovcc.yaml`.
 * The `render` function in `/instruction` will keep `cc` lowercased.
 *
 * For exclusively vector instructions (ones where `V???` exist, but not `???`),
 *   the data files are stored at `data/instructions/?/???.yaml` (with no
 *   leading `v`).
 * For example, the nicely named `VCVTNEPS2BF16` is located at
 *   `data/instructions/c/cvtneps2bf16.yaml` (note the missing `v`).
 *
 * FMA instructions are handled similarly, but with an additional change.
 * Due to the multiple forms that only differ in parameter order (named with
 *   numerals 1, 2, and 3 in the mnemonic), they are stored the same as above,
 *   but with an additional change:
 * The three numbers are replaced with `nnn` (`/[123]{3}/nnn/` in regex).
 * The `render` function in `/instruction` will detect the `nnn` and replace
 *   them with three number symbols (`###`) (octothorpe for you fancy people).
 * This is to avoid issues with `#` in URLs.
