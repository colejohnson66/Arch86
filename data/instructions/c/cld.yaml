description: >-
  The \c{CLD} instruction clears the \reg{DF} (direction) flag in the \reg{EFLAGS} register.

  The direction flag controls the direction of string operations such as \instr{MOVS}.
  When clear, string operations will increment the index registers (\reg{ESI} and/or \reg{EDI}) during operation.
  When set, they will be decremented instead.
