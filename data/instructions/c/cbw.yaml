  The \c{CBW} instruction sign extends \reg{AL} into \reg{AX}.

  This instruction shares its opcode with \instr{CWDE}.
  Which one will be used depends on the operating mode of the processor (\c{CBW} in 16 bit mode and \c{CWDE} in 32 bit mode).
  To force the use of the other one (i.e. \c{CBW} in 32 bit mode and \c{CWDE} in 16 bit mode), prefix this instruction with \instr{OPSIZE} (\c{0x66}).
