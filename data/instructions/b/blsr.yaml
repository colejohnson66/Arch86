description: >-
  The \c{BLSMSK} instruction clears the lowest set bit of the source operand and writes the result to the destination operand.
  All other bits in the source operand are untouched.

  The \reg{CF} flag is set if the source is not zero.
  This can be useful to detect if the destination operand will have anything set without actually testing it.

  The operand size (\c{W} bit) is always 32 bits if not in Long Mode.
  In other words, in Protected and Compatibility Mode, \c{VEX.W1} is treated as \c{VEX.W0}.

  The length field (\c{L} bit) \i{must} be zero (signifying 128 bit vectors).
  Attempts to execute with \c{VEX.L1} (256 bit vectors) will cause a \c{#UD} exception.
operation: |-
  public void BLSR_32(ref uint dest, uint src)
  {
    dest = src & (src - 1);
    CF = (src != 0);
  }

  public void BLSR_64(ref ulong dest, ulong src)
  {
    dest = src & (src - 1);
    CF = (src != 0);
  }
flags:
  CF: Set if the source is not zero. Cleared otherwise.
  PF: Undefined.
  AF: Undefined.
  ZF: Set according to the result.
  SF: Set according to the result.
  OF: Cleared.

      Officially, this instruction is titled "Reset Lowest Set Bit".
      This is changed here for consistency (clearing a bit sets it to 0).
    - >-
      The \c{BLSR r64, r/m64} form is incorrectly documented as being "not encodable" in 32 bit mode.
      This is misleading as it \i{is} encodable, but is defined to be treated as the 32 bit form.
