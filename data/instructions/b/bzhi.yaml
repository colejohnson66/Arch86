description: >-
  The \c{BZHI} instruction zeros the high bits of the first source operand starting at the index specified in the lowest 8 bits of the second source operand.
  The result is stored in the destination operand.

  The low 8 bits of the second source operand (the index) \i{must not} exceed the bit width of the operands.
  In other words, for the 32 bit form, the second source operand's low 8 bits must be 31 or less.
  The 64 bit form changes this requirement to 63 or less.

      The \c{BZHI r64a, r/m64, r64b} form is incorrectly documented as being "not encodable" in 32 bit mode.
      This is misleading as it \i{is} encodable, but is defined to be treated as the 32 bit form.
