description: >-
  The \c{BNDCL} instruction compares the address in the second source operand (a GPR or memory location) against the lower bound (\c{LB}) in the first source operand (a bound register).
  If the second source operand is lower, a \c{#BR} exception is thrown, and \c{BNDSTATUS} is set to \c{1h}.

  If the second source operand is a general purpose register, the value contained in it is treated as the address to compare against.
  If, however, it is a memory location, the effective address is calculated (see \instr{LEA}) and used in the comparison.
  At no time is memory accessed, and the flags are untouched.

  Which instruction form (32 or 64 bit) is used depends on the operating mode of the processor.
  In 16 and 32 bit mode, the 32 bit form is used, and, in 64 bit mode, the 64 bit form is used.
  This distinction is irrelevant for the memory form.

  list:
    - >-
      The overview table only mentions 32 and 64 bit mode support.
      However, this instruction is supported in all modes.
    - >-
      The "Encoding" section incorrectly lists the first operand (the bound register) as being written to.
      It is actually only read.
