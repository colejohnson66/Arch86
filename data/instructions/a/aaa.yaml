  The \c{AAA} instruction converts the result of an addition of two BCD digits to a valid 2-digit BCD number.

  This instruction will not be useful unless it immediately follows an \instr{ADD} instruction using the \reg{AL} register and a single digit operand (either register or immediate).
  An example of such usage is below.

  Traditionally, this instruction is "ASCII Adjust After Addition".
  This would lead one to believe that it works on ASCII digits (\c{030h} (\c{0}) through \c{039h} (\c{9})), however this would be incorrect.
  This instruction \i{actually} operates on BCD digits (\c{00h} (\c{0}) through \c{09h} (\c{9})).

  This instruction operates on only the lower 4 bits of \reg{AL}.
  This instruction will only execute if the lower 4 bits of \reg{AL} are greater than 9, or if the \reg{AF} flag is set.

operationNotes:
  - >-
    According to the source code for Bochs' (\c{/cpu/bcd.cc}), this instruction is implemented differently on the 80186 and prior.
    This different operation is shown above.
examples:
  - |-
    mov ax, 0x106 ; 16 (decimal) in BCD
    add al, 5     ; AX == 0x10B
    aaa           ; AX == 0x202 (22 (decimal)) in BCD
  - |-
    ; Also handles overflow into the upper 4 bits of AL
    mov ax, 0x109 ; 19 (decimal) in BCD
    add al, 9     ; AX == 0x112; AF == 1
    aaa           ; AX == 0x208 (28 (decimal)) in BCD
flags:
  CF: Set if an adjustment is made. Cleared otherwise.
  PF: Undefined.
  AF: Set if an adjustment is made. Cleared otherwise.
  ZF: Undefined.
  SF: Undefined.
  OF: Undefined.
