                        <p>
                            The flags register (<code>RFLAGS</code>) is a 64 bit bitfield register.
                            It contains a few bits of information that is designed to be accessible by any program, but not necessarily writable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is accessible through three overlapping &quot;registers&quot;: <code>FLAGS</code> for the lower 16 bits, <code>EFLAGS</code> for the lower 32, and <code>RFLAGS</code> for all 64.
                            Despite the fact that only bits 0 through 21 are defined, <code>RFLAGS</code> exists for consistency with the rest of the x86-64 register set.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="headingList">List of Fields</h2>

                            In ascending order (least significant to most significant bit), the register contains the following bits of information:

                                On the 80486 and older processors, attempts to set this bit will fail as the processor will just clear it.
                                However, Pentium (and newer) processors (which support <code>CPUID</code>) will allow writing to this bit.

                                Therefore, support for the <code>CPUID</code> instruction can be checked by setting this bit, storing it in the flags register, then rereading that register again.
                                If this bit is still set, the CPU supports <code>CPUID</code>.

                            On the 8085 (the predecessor to the <A href="/architecture/8086">8086</A>), there exists an 8 bit flag register.
                            It is the basis for the x86 flags register of today, and, short of two changes, was the same as the lowest 8 bits of x86&apos;s <code>FLAGS</code> register.
                            Those two changes are: the undocumented &quot;V&quot; and the &quot;K&quot; flags.<Ref.Link name="VKFlags" />{" "}
                            These reside in bits 1 and 5, respectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The V flag resides in bit 1 of the flag register and simply indicated a signed overflow or underflow.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote className="blockquote">
                            The V flag is simply the exclusive-or of the carry into the top bit and the carry out of the top bit.
                            This is a standard formula for computing overflow for signed addition and subtraction.

                            The K flag resides in bit 5 of the flag register and stores the result of exclusive ORing (XOR) the V flag with the most significant bit of the result.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote className="blockquote">
                            One mystery was the purpose of the K flag: &quot;It does not resemble any normal flag bit.&quot;
                            Its use for increment and decrement is clear, but for arithmetic operations why would you want the exclusive-or of the overflow and sign?
                            It turns out the the K flag is useful for signed comparisons.
                            If you&apos;re comparing two signed values, the first is smaller if the exclusive-or of the sign and overflow is 1.
                            This is exactly what the K flag computes.
                            <Ref.Link name="VKFlags" />

                        <p>
                            These bits were removed with the introduction of the 8086 and defined to be a 1 for the V flag (bit 1) and a 0 for the K flag (bit 5).
                            To this day, these fixed values have stayed, and attempts to change them, or any other reserved bits, is undefined.
